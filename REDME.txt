At the beginning I wanted to say that I did not give a lot of comments.
I tried not to repeat so that one part of the code to comment only once.
In places where code writing was repeated, for obvious reasons I did not write comments.
Unfortunately, I did not have all the assets needed to create an identical IU as in the picture
Unfortunately, I could not pass the variables to lokalSorage from the first page so that they were saved and forwarded but I wanted to do it :) I just lacked time.
I used jQuery to select and change the css class of these buttons.

The js file is in navigation.
Information on RWD:
I wrote both sides for mobile devices emulated in DevTools.
There was no formula for the phone, so I used the standard. Another element under the next element.
In css I haven't commented too much because I think it is readable.
